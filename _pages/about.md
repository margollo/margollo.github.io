I am a reasercher in mathematics currently working at the maths department of the [Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid](https://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/inicio) as a Ramon y Cajal fellow, also associated to the [Instituto de Ciencias Matem&aacute;ticas](https://www.icmat.es) in Madrid.

Before coming to Madrid I had been a PostDoc at the Free University of Brussels with the FWO (Flemish Science Foundation) and at the University of Murcia with a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant. That followed my studies and PhD at the University of Stuttgart under the supervision of Wolfgang Kimmerle. Between August 2021 and December 2022 I was a Severo Ochoa fellow, employed directly by the ICMAT.

My main interest lies in understanding group rings and how their structure is connected to the group used to define them. To do that I use mostly group theory and representation theory (ordinary, modular, p-adic and integral), but also some algebraic combinatorics, ring theory, cohomology and computer algebra. 

<u>News: </u> The next edition of [Groups in Madrid](https://sites.google.com/view/groupsinmadrid/home) will happen from 17th-18th of October.
