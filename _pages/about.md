I am a reasercher in mathematics currently working at the [Instituto de Ciencias Matem&aacute;ticas](https://www.icmat.es) in Madrid as a Severo Ochoa PostDoc.

Before coming to Madrid I had been a PostDoc at the Free University of Brussels with the FWO (Flemish Science Foundation) and at the University of Murcia with a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant. That followed my studies and PhD at the University of Stuttgart under the supervision of Wolfgang Kimmerle. 

My main interest lies in understanding group rings and how their structure is connected to the group used to define them. To do that I use mostly group theory and representation theory (ordinary, modular, p-adic and integral), but also some algebraic combinatorics, ring theory, cohomology and computer algebra.
