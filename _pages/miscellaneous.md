## Manneken Pisthagoras ##

Arriving as a PostDoc in Brussels at the end of 2017 I immediately became a huge fan of its symbol: The 61cm tall peing metal boy known as Manneken Pis. What is less known, is that he regularly wears different dresses of which the 1000th was gifted to him in May 2018. Nevertheless, our research uncovered that there was not one costume devoted to mathematics!

After contacting the city of Brussels, the beutiful work of our designer Julie de Kezel and several delays we were finally able to inagurate _Manneken Pisthagoras_ in Septmeber 2021. A very proud moment.

P.S.: Please check, if your country is already represented in a Manneken Pis costume [here](https://www.mannekenpis.brussels/en/more-than-1000-costumes). If not write to your ambassador in Belgium or to your head of state.
