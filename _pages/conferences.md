## Groups in Madrid ## 

As a group theorist in Madrid I am one of the organizers of the yearly congress Groups in Madrid. [This](https://sites.google.com/view/groupsinmadrid/home) was the last edition (or the next, depending on which time of the year it is).

I am also the organizer of the [Group Theory Seminar of Madrid](https://sites.google.com/view/groupsinmadridseminar/) which takes place weekly during term.

## Groups and their actions: algebraic, geometric and combinatorial aspects ##

Together with my colleagues Geoffrey Janssens (UC Louvain), Martina Lanini (Roma Tor Vergata) and Mima Stanojkovski (Trento) we have recently organized the conference [Groups and their actions: algebraic, geometric and combinatorial aspects](https://gaagc24.github.io/) in the beautiful town of Levico Terme.
